==================
Changelog
==================

Versions follow `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`_ (``<major>.<minor>.<patch>``),
but with minor syntax differences to satisfy python package
`version specifiers <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers/>`_.

Until a stable version is released (end of beta), new versions may contain backward-incompatible changes,
but we will strive to deprecate features first instead of immediately removal.
After that, breaking changes will only be introduced in major versions.
